# Processed Data Information for Stroke Prediction Analysis

This README file provides details about the processed data used in the stroke prediction analysis project.

## Overview

The processed dataset is derived from the raw data after applying various transformations and cleaning steps. This dataset is structured to facilitate analysis and model training.

## Transformations Applied

1. **Missing Value Handling**: 
   - Missing values were identified and addressed through imputation or removal, depending on the context and significance of the missing data.

2. **Categorical Encoding**: 
   - Categorical variables were encoded using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding to convert them into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

3. **Feature Scaling**: 
   - Numerical features were scaled using standardization (z-score normalization) or min-max scaling to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model training process.

4. **Feature Selection**: 
   - Irrelevant or redundant features were removed based on correlation analysis and domain knowledge to improve model performance and interpretability.

## Dataset Structure

The processed dataset is structured as follows:

- **Columns**: 
  - Each column represents a feature relevant to stroke prediction, including demographic information, health metrics, and lifestyle factors.
  
- **Target Variable**: 
  - The target variable indicates whether a stroke occurred (1) or not (0).

## Usage

This processed dataset is ready for use in exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation. Ensure to refer to the accompanying scripts for detailed methodologies on how the data was processed and utilized in the analysis.
