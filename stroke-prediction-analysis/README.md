  - **raw/**: Original data files.
  - **processed/**: Cleaned and transformed data files.
  
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter Notebook for the stroke prediction analysis.
  
- **src/**: Source code for data handling and model training.
  - **data_loading.py**: Functions to load datasets.
  - **data_cleaning.py**: Functions to clean and preprocess data.
  - **data_analysis.py**: Functions for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
  - **model_training.py**: Functions to train machine learning models.
  - **model_evaluation.py**: Functions to evaluate model performance.
  - **model_interpretation.py**: Functions to interpret model predictions.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the required Python libraries for the project.
